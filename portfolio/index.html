            Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This site highlights my background,
            skills, and projects related to information technology and web development.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently studying Computer Information Technology and enjoy learning how
            structured and well planned systems support real world solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I continue developing this site, I will be adding project examples,
            technical skills, and contact information.
